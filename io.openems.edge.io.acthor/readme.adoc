= AC-Thor Heating Element

AC Thor is a 3 phase heating element, with a maximum power of 1-3kW per phase. 

This implementation reads from 3 digital inputs and sets the `Power` channel appropriately. 
The power channel is set to

* 3000: One of the phases will be switched on with full power
* 6000: Two of the phases will be switched on with full power
* 9000: All three phases will be switched on with full power 

depending on the state of the thre digial inputs.
